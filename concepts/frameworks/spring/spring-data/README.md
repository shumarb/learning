| Reduces Boilerplate   | Significantly reduces writable code with use of a repository interface and declaring simple methods in it.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Flexibility           | Provides support for both SQL relational and NoSQL databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Improved Productivity | By abstracting away the complexity of data access and providing ready-made solutions (like automatic query generation, pagination, and sorting), Spring Data allows developers to focus on business logic rather than the intricacies of database interaction. |
