# Adjacency List

## Overview
An `Adjacency List` is a graph data structure where each `vertex` maintains a list of its `adjacent` vertices and the weights of the connecting `edges`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [AdjacencyList.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/blob/main/code/data-structures/AdjacencyList.java), and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/BasicOperations.java).
3. Store both files in the same directory (e.g., Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a `terminal` and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the files using `javac AdjacencyList.java BasicOperations.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java AdjacencyList`.
7. The program creates an `Adjacency List` comprising `3 to 7` vertices, and each vertex is denoted by a `letter`. The `weight` of the edges are between `-100 to 100`.
