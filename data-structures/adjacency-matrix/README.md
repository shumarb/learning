# Adjacency Matrix

## Overview
An `Adjacency Matrix` is a `2D array` representing a `graph`. 
The value at index `[i][j]` indicates the weight of the `edge` connecting vertices `i` and `j`. 
If no `edge` exists between these vertices, the value is typically `zero` or `infinity`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [AdjacencyMatrix.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/blob/main/data-structures/AdjacencyMatrix.java), and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/BasicOperations.java).
3. Store both files in the same directory (e.g. Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a `terminal` and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the files using `javac AdjacencyMatrix.java BasicOperations.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java AdjacencyMatrix`.
7. The program creates an `Adjacency Matrix` comprising `3 to 7` vertices, and each vertex is denoted by a `letter`. The `weight` of the edges are between `-100 to 100`.
