# Array

## Overview
An `Array` is a **linear, static data structure** where elements are either `sorted` or `unsorted`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [Array.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/Array.java), and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/BasicOperations.java).
3. Store both files in the same directory (e.g., Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a `terminal` and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the files using `javac Array.java BasicOperations.java`.
6. Run the program with `java Array`.
7. The program creates an integer array with elements ranging from -10 to 10 and a size between 5 and 12, demonstrating operations on the array.
