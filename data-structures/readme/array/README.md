# Array

## What is an Array?
An `Array` is a **linear, static data structure** where elements are either `sorted` or `unsorted`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code) repository: [Array.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/Array.java), and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/BasicOperations.java).If you have not cloned this repository on your local machine, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/shumarb/learning#how-to-use-this-repository).
3. Ensure the aforementioned java source files are stored in the same directory (Example: Both are in the Downloads folder).
4. Open `terminal`.
5. Navigate to the location of aforementioned java source files.
6. Compile the aforementioned java source files by entering `javac Array.java BasicOperations.java`.
7. Run the program by entering `java Array`.
8. The program creates an `array`. The elements are of type `integer` ranging from `-10 to 10`, and the number of elements range from `5 to 12`. The program demonstrates the application of these operations on the `array`.
