# Binary Max Heap

## Overview 
A `Binary Max Heap` is a **complete binary tree (non-linear and dynamic data structure)** where `each` element is `>=` all of it's `children (if any)`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [BinaryMaxHeap.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/BinaryMaxHeap.java), and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/BasicOperations.java).
3. Store both Java source files in the same directory (e.g., Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the files using `javac BinaryMaxHeap.java BasicOperations.java`.
6. Compile the program by entering `javac BinaryMaxHeap.java`.
7. Run the program by entering `java BinaryMaxHeap`.
8. The program creates a `Binary Max Heap` and demonstrates the `insertion`, `search`, and `deletion` operations. The elements are of type `integer`, and the value of each element is between `-100 to 100`, and the number of elements is between `5 to 12`.
