# Binary Max Heap

## Overview 
A `Binary Max Heap` is a **complete binary tree (non-linear and dynamic data structure)** where `each` element is `>=` all of it's `children (if any)`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download [BinaryMaxHeap.java](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/tree/main/data-structures/code/BinaryMaxHeap.java) and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/tree/main/data-structures/code/BasicOperations.java)
3. Open `terminal` and navigate to the location of these 2 files.
4. Compile both programs by entering `javac BinaryMaxHeap.java` and `javac BasicOperations.java`.
5. Compile the program by entering `javac BinaryMaxHeap.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java BinaryMaxHeap`.
7. The program creates a `Binary Max Heap` and demonstrates the `insertion`, `search`, and `deletion` operations. The elements are of type `integer`, and the value of each element is between `-100 to 100`, and the number of elements is between `5 to 12`.
