# Binary Min Heap

## Overview 
A `Binary Min Heap` is a **complete binary tree (non-linear and dynamic data structure)** where `each` element is `<=` all of it's `children (if any)`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download [BinaryMinHeap.java](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/tree/main/data-structures/code/BinaryMinHeap.java) and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/tree/main/data-structures/code/BasicOperations.java)
3. Open `terminal` and navigate to the location of these 2 files.
4. Compile both programs by entering `javac BinaryMaxHeap.java` and `javac BasicOperations.java`.
5. Compile the program by entering `javac BinaryMinHeap.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java BinaryMinHeap`.
7. The program creates a `binary min heap`. The elements are of type `integer`, and the number of elements range from `5 to 12`. The program demonstrates the application of these operations on the `binary min heap`.
