# HashMap

## What is a HashMap?
A `HashMap` is a **linear and dynamic** data structure operating that uses a `hash function` to efficiently map keys to values.

According to [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/hashtable), in order to implement efficient `hashing`, the `hash function` has to be fast to compute, uses as minimum slots out of the size of the `HashMap` as possible, scatter the keys into different base addresses as uniformly as possible âˆˆ [0..M-1] for a `HashMap` of size M, and experience as minimum collisions as possible.

## Key Operations of an HashMap
| Operation                 | Explanation                                                                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| add(Element e)            | Add the element to end of the HashMap                                                      |
| add(int index, Element e) | Add the element at specified index of the HashMap                                          |
| clear()                   | Remove all the elements in the HashMap                                                     |
| contains(Element e)       | Return true if the HashMap contains the specified element, else return false               |
| get(int index)            | Retrieve the element at the specified index. Note: Ensure 0 <= index < size of the HashMap |
| isEmpty()                 | Return true if the HashMap is empty, else return false                                     |
| remove(int index)         | Remove the element at specified index of the HashMap                                       |
| set(int index, Element e) | Replace the current element at specified index of the HashMap with the specified element   |
| size()                    | Obtain the number of elements in HashMap                                                   |

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download [HashMapExample.java](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/tree/main/data-structures/code/HashMapExample.java) and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/tree/main/data-structures/code/BasicOperations.java)
3. Open `terminal` and navigate to the location of these 2 files.
4. Compile both programs by entering `javac HashMapExample.java` and `javac BasicOperations.java`.
5. Run the program by entering `java HashMapExample`.
6. The program creates an `HashMap`. The elements are of type `integer`, and the number of elements range from `5 to 12`. The program provides a brief explanation of a `HashMap` and it's `key` operations, and demonstrates the application of these operations on the `HashMap`.
