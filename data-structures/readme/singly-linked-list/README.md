# Singly Linked List

## Overview
An `Singly Linked List` is a **linear and dynamic** data structure where each element contains a pointer to it's next element.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download [QueueExample.java](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/tree/main/data-structures/code/SinglyLinkedList.java) and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/tree/main/data-structures/code/BasicOperations.java)
3. Open `terminal` and navigate to the location of these 2 files.
4. Compile both programs by entering `javac SinglyLinkedList.java` and `javac BasicOperations.java`.
5. Run the program by entering `java SinglyLinkedList`.
6. The program creates a `Singly Linked List`. The elements are of type `integer`, and the number of elements range from `5 to 12`. The program provides a brief explanation of a `Singly Linked List` and it's `key` operations, and demonstrates the application of these operations on the `Singly Linked List`.
