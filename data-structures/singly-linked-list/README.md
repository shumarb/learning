# Singly Linked List

## Overview
An `Singly Linked List` is a **linear and dynamic** data structure where each element contains a pointer to it's next element.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [SinglyLinkedList.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/data-structures/SinglyLinkedList.java), and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/BasicOperations.java).
3. Store both files in the same directory (e.g. Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the files using `javac SinglyLinkedList.java BasicOperations.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java SinglyLinkedList`.
7. The program creates a `Singly Linked List`. The elements are of type `integer`, and the number of elements range from `5 to 12`. The program provides a brief explanation of a `Singly Linked List` and it's `key` operations, and demonstrates the application of these operations on the `Singly Linked List`.
