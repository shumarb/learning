# AVL Tree

## What is an AVL Tree?
An `AVL Tree` is a **complete binary tree (non-linear and dynamic data structure)** where `each` element is `>=` all elements in it's `left subtree`, and `<` all elements in it's `right subtree`. An `AVL Tree` is also a `self-balancing Binary Search Tree`.

3. Open `terminal`.
4. Navigate to the location where the repository is cloned.
5. Navigate to the `avl-tree` folder by entering `cd data-structure/tree/avl-tree`.
6. Compile the program by entering `javac AVLTree.java`.
7. Run the program by entering `java AVLTree`.
8. The program creates an `AVL Tree`. The elements are of type `integer`, and the number of elements range from `5 to 12`. The program demonstrates the application of these operations on the `AVL Tree`.
