## What is a Binary Max Heap?
A `Binary Max Heap` is a **complete binary tree (non-linear and dynamic data structure)** where `each` element is `>=` all of it's `children (if any)`.

## Instructions
1. If you have not cloned this repository on your local machine, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/shumarb/learning#how-to-use-this-repository).
2. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
3. Open `terminal`.
4. Navigate to the location where the repository is cloned.
5. Navigate to the `binary-max-heap` folder by entering `cd data-structure/tree/binary-max-heap`.
6. Compile the program by entering `javac BinaryMaxHeap.java`.
7. Run the program by entering `java BinaryMaxHeap`.
8. The program creates a `binary max heap` and demonstrates the `insertion`, `search`, and `deletion` operations. The elements are of type `integer`, the value of each element is between `-100 to 100`, and the number of elements is between `5 to 12`.
