# Non-relational Databases

## Definition
Non-relational databases (NoSQL databases), store data in a more flexible format, which can include key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graphs. 
They do not require a fixed schema, allowing for dynamic data storage.

## Key Characteristics
- **Flexibility**: NoSQL databases can handle unstructured or semi-structured data and allow for changes in the data model without extensive reconfiguration.
- **Scalability**: They are designed to scale out horizontally, making them suitable for handling large volumes of data and high-velocity workloads.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Many NoSQL databases sacrifice ACID properties for availability and partition tolerance, often employing eventual consistency models.

## Examples
Examples of non-relational databases are MongoDB (document store), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (wide-column store), Neo4j (graph database).
