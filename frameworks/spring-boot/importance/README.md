# Spring Boot

## Importance
- Simplified Setup: Reduces the complexity of configuration and setup with its convention-over-configuration approach.
- Inversion of Control (IoC): Manages dependencies and object creation through dependency injection, promoting loose coupling.
- Embedded Containers: Includes embedded servers (e.g. Tomcat) for running applications without needing a separate web server setup.
- Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures components based on the projectâ€™s dependencies, reducing the need for manual configuration.
- Production-Ready Features: Provides built-in features like metrics, health checks, and application monitoring to ease the deployment and maintenance of applications.
