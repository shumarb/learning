# Graph Data Structures 

A `Graph` can be constructed via these `graph data structures`:

## How to use this folder
1. If you have not cloned this repository on your local machine, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/shumarb/learning#how-to-use-this-repository).
2. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
3. Open `terminal`.
4. Navigate to the location where the repository is cloned.
5. Navigate to the name of a `graph-data-structure` folder by entering `cd graphs/graph-data-structures/graph-data-structure-name (eg: cd graphs/graph-data-structures/adjacency-matrix)`.
6. Compile the program by entering `javac graph-data-structure-name.java (eg: javac adjacency-matrix)`.
8.  The program creates a `graph` comprising of `3 to 7` vertices, and each vertex is denoted by a `letter`. The `weight` of the edges are betewen `-100 to 100`. The program displays information of the `graph data structure`, from which you can draw the `undirected and weighted graph`.
