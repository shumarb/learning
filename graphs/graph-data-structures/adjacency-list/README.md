## Instructions
1. If you have not cloned this repository on your local machine, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/shumarb/learning#how-to-use-this-repository).
2. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
3. Open `terminal`.
4. Navigate to the location where the repository is cloned.
5. Navigate to the `adjacency-list` folder by entering `cd graphs/graph-data-structures/adjacency-list`.
6. Compile the program by entering `javac AdjacencyList.java`.
7. Run the program by entering `java AdjacencyList`.
8. The program creates an `Adjacency List` comprising of `3 to 7` vertices, and each vertex is denoted by a `letter`. The `weight` of the edges are betewen `-100 to 100`. The program displays the `Adjacency List`, from which you can draw the `undirected and weighted graph`.
