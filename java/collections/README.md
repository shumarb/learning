# Collections

## Overview
The Java Collections Framework is a set of `interfaces`, `classes`, and `algorithms` that provide `data structures` to `store` and `manipulate`groups of objects.

| Improved Efficiency | Collections are optimized for performance, providing algorithms for sorting, search, and data manipulation that are faster to manually implementing these features. |
| Flexibility         | Collections allow developers to choose the appropriate data structure for specific use cases.                                                                       |
| Code Reusability    | The collections framework provides ready-to-use set of data structures and algorithms, reducing the need to write manual implementations.                           |
