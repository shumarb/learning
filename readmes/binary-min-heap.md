# Binary Min Heap

## Overview 
A `Binary Min Heap` is a **complete binary tree (non-linear and dynamic data structure)**
where `each` element is `smaller than or equal to` all of it's `children (if any)`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [BinaryMinHeap.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/data-structures/BinaryMinHeap.java), and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/BasicOperations.java).
3. Store both files in the same directory (e.g. Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the files using `javac BinaryMinHeap.java BasicOperations.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java BinaryMinHeap`.
7. The program creates a `Binary Min Heap`. The elements are of type `integer`, and the number of elements range from `5 to 12`. The program demonstrates the application of these operations on the `binary min heap`.
