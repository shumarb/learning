# Binary Search Tree

## Overview
A `Binary Search Tree` is an **ordered binary tree (non-linear and dynamic data structure)** where `each` element is `>=` all elements in it's `left subtree`, and `<` all elements in it's `right subtree`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [BinarySearchTree.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/data-structures/BinarySearchTree.java), [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/support/BasicOperations.java), and [Node.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/support/Node.java).
3. Store all three files in the same directory (e.g. Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the files using `javac BinarySearchTree.java BasicOperations.java Node.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java BinarySearchTree`.
7. The program creates a `Binary Search Tree`. The elements are of type `integer`, and the number of elements range from `5 to 12`. The program demonstrates the application of these operations on the `Binary Search Tree`.
