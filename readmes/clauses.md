# Clauses

## Overview
The following illustrates the clauses used in SQL:

| Clause   | Explanation                                                                                                     |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SELECT   | Retrieves data from one or more columns in a table.                                                             |
| FROM     | Identifies table to apply SQL on.                                                                               |
| WHERE    | Filters rows before grouping/aggregation occurs, based on `one or more conditions`.                             |
| GROUP BY | Groups rows by one or more non-aggregate columns. Applicable when one or more aggregate function is used.       |
| HAVING   | Filters groups after the `GROUP BY` clause. Used to filter results of aggregate functions.                      |
| ORDER BY | Sorts the result set based on one or more columns, either in ascending (`ASC`; default) or descending (`DESC`). |
