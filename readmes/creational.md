# Creational Design Pattern

## Overview
Creational design patterns provide `object creation mechanisms` to `increase flexibility` and promote `code reuse`.

## Example
| Creational Design Pattern | Explanation                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstract Factory          | Create families of related objects without specifying its concrete class.                                          |
| Builder                   | Construct objects of the same type but with different attribute values  using the same construction code.          |
| Factory Method            | Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. |
| Prototype                 | Copy existing objects whilst ensuring that the source code is not dependent on its classes.                        | 
| Singleton                 | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.                                 |                                              |
