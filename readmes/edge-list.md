# Edge List

## Overview
An `Edge List` is a graph data structure that represents all `edges` in a graph, with each `edge` defined by two `vertices` it connects and its `weight`.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [EdgeList.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/blob/main/data-structures/EdgeList.java), [IntegerTriple.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/blob/main/support/IntegerTriple.java),and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/support/BasicOperations.java).
3. Store both files in the same directory (e.g. Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a `terminal` and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the program by entering `javac EdgeList.java BasicOperations.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java EdgeList`.
7. The program creates an `Edge List` comprising `3 to 7` vertices, and each vertex is denoted by a `letter`. The `weight` of the edges are between `-100 to 100`. The program displays the `Edge List`, from which you can draw the `undirected and weighted graph`.
