# Relational Databases

## Definition
Relational databases (SQL databases) store `data` in structured formats using `tables`. Each table consists of `rows (records)` and `columns (fields)`.

## Key Characteristics
- **Schema**: Relational databases have a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships.
- **ACID Compliance**: They support ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable transactions.
- **Query Language**: SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. It allows you to perform operations like querying data, updating records, and managing database structures.

## Examples
Examples of relational databases are MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.
