# Software Testing

## Overview
Software Testing is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure it meets specified requirements and functions correctly, identifying any defects or issues to ensure quality and reliability.

## Testing Techniques
- Unit Testing
  - **Definition**: Testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
  - **Tools**: JUnit, NUnit, pytest.

- Integration Testing
  - **Definition**: Testing the interaction between integrated components or systems to ensure they work together as expected.
  - **Tools**: Postman, TestNG, Mockito.

- Performance Testing
  - **Definition**: Evaluating the system's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under varying loads.
  - **Types**: Load testing, stress testing, endurance testing.
  - **Tools**: JMeter, Gatling, LoadRunner.

- Automated Testing
  - **Definition**: Using scripts and tools to automate repetitive testing tasks.
  - **Tools**: Selenium, Cypress, TestCafe.

- Regression Testing
  - **Definition**: Testing existing software functionalities to ensure that new code changes have not adversely affected them. This is crucial after updates or bug fixes.
  - **Tools**: Selenium, QTP, TestComplete.

- System Testing 
  - **Definition**: Testing the complete and integrated software system to evaluate its compliance with the specified requirements. It assesses the system as a whole in a production-like environment.
  - **Tools**: TestRail, Quality Center.

## Conclusion
Software Testing is critical in order to deliver high-quality software based on these principles:
- **Validation**: Ensuring the software meets user needs and requirements.
- **Verification**: Checking if the software is built correctly according to specifications.
- **Defect Identification**: Finding and addressing bugs or issues before deployment.
