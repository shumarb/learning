# Design Patterns

## Overview
Design Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern serves as a template that a developer can customise
to solve a design problem in the source code.

Design Patterns are classified by its complexity, level of detail, and scalability of the application. 
Hence, it can be broadly classified into these categories:

| Design Pattern                                                                                              |

| Reusability   | Allow developers to reuse tried-and-tested solutions for different projects, reducing development time and errors.  |
| Maintenance   | Enhance code is organised and readable, ensuring multiple developers to collaborate effectively on the source code. |
| Communication | Design patterns provide a common vocabulary for developers, making it easier to communicate complex ideas.          |
