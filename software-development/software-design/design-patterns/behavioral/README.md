# Behavioral Design Pattern

## Overview
Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects. They help define how objects interact and delegate responsibilities, promoting more flexible and easier-to-understand workflows. These patterns often involve complex control flows and responsibilities among objects.

| Observer  | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.                                                                                                                                                  | An example is a social media user wanting to be notified every time someone follows them.                                                                                        |
| Iterator	 | Provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.	A social media user's friend list allows iteration over friends without revealing how they are stored. The user can view each friend one at a time using the Iterator interface. | A social media user's friend list allows iteration over friends without revealing how they are stored.
