# Behavioral Design Pattern

## Overview
Behavioral design patterns focus on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities of objects.

## Example
| Pattern   | Explanation                                                                                                                |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Guard     | Ensures one or more conditions are satisfied before executing an operation.                                                | 
| Iterator	 | Traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.                                          |
| Observer  | Defines a mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to an object that these objects are observing. |                                                     |
| Strategy  | Define a family of algorithms, put each of it into separate classes, and make their objects interchangeable.               |
