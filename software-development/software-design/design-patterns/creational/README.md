# Creational Design Pattern

## Overview
Creational design patterns focus on the process of object creation. They abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and efficient.

## Example
| Creational Design Pattern | Explanation                                                                                                        | Example                                                                                                                 |

| Singleton                 | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.                                 | In a home, there exists only one Fridge that serves all household members.                                              |
| Factory Method            | Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. | A bakery that produces different types of cakes based on customer orders without revealing the specific baking process. |
