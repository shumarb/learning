# Structural Design Pattern

## Overview
Structural design patterns focus on `assembling objects and classes` into `larger structures`, whilst keeping these structures `flexible and efficient`.

| Importance               | Explanation                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simplified relationships | Reduce the complexity of how objects are connected or composed within a system.                |
| Flexibility              | Easier to add or modify components without affecting the rest of the system.                   |
| Reusability              | By reusing common patterns for organizing objects, code becomes more modular and maintainable. |

|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adapter   | Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.                                                                                |
| Bridge    | Split a large class into two separate hierarchies - `Abstraction` and `Implementation` - which are developed independently of one another. |
| Composite | Compose objects into tree structures, and work on these structures as if it were individual objects.                                       |
| Decorator | Attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behavior.                         |
| Facade    | Provides a simplified interface to a complex set of classes.                                                                               |
