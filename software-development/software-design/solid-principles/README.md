# SOLID Principles

## Overview
This section explains the SOLID Principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle
  - A class should have only one reason to change.
- Open/Closed Principles
  - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) are open for extension but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle
  - A `Parent` class can be substituted with its `Child` class without changing the program's behavior.
- Interface Segregation Principle
  - Interfaces should be small and dealing with one aspect of a problem.
- Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Classes should depend upon `abstract` concepts rather than `concrete` implementations.
