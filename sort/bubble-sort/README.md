# Bubble Sort

## Overview
Bubble Sort is a **comparison-based, in-place, and stable** sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if both these elements are in the wrong order.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download these Java source files in the [Code](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main) repository: [BubbleSort.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/sort/BubbleSort.java), and [BasicOperations.java](https://github.com/shumarb/code/tree/main/code/BasicOperations.java).
3. Store both files in the same directory (e.g., Downloads) if they are in different directories.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory in Step 3.
5. Compile the files using `javac BasicOperations.java BubbleSort.java`.
6. Run the program by entering `java BubbleSort`.
7. The program creates an array randomly. The elements are of type `integer`. The number of elements range from `5 to 12`, and the value elements range from `-100 to 100`. The program displays the array before the sort, the relevant steps during the sort, the array after the sort, and the side-by-side comparison of the array before and after the sort.
