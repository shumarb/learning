# Quick Sort

## Overview
Quick Sort is a **comparison-based, in-place, and unstable** `divide-and-conquer` sorting algorithm that works by selecting an element as a pivot, forming 2 partitions by shifting all elements smaller and larger than the pivot to the left and right of the pivot respectively, and recursively sorts these 2 partitions.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Download the Quick Sort [code](https://github.com/shumarb/learning/blob/main/sort/quick-sort/QuickSort.java).
3. Open up `terminal` and navigate to the location the code in `Step 2` is located.
4. Compile the program by entering `javac QuickSort.java`.
5. Run the program by entering `java QuickSort`.
6. The program creates an array randomly. The elements are of type `integer`. The number of elements range from `5 to 12`, and the value elements range from `-100 to 100`. The program displays the array before the sort, the relevant steps during the sort, the array after the sort, and the side-by-side comparison of the array before and after the sort.
