# Quick Sort

## What is Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a **comparison-based, in-place, and unstable** divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting an element as a pivot, forming 2 partitions by shifting all elements smaller and larger than the pivot to the left and right of the pivot respectively, and recursively sorts these 2 partitions.

## Worst-case Time Complexity
**O($N^2$)**.

The worst-case scenario is when the elements of the array are in reversed order. Hence, each of the N elements is selected as the pivot for each iteration, and a swap of elements occurs for each iteration. Hence, N elements are selected as the pivot N times.

## Space Complexity
**O(1)**.

A constant amount of time of extra space is required.

## How to use this folder
1. Ensure that your local machine configured with a `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later`.
2. Open up `terminal`.
3. Navigate to this directory by entering `cd selection-sort`.
4. Compile the program by entering `javac QuickSort.java`.
5. Run the program by entering `java QuickSort`.
6. The program creates an array randomly. The elements are of type `integer`. The number of elements range from `5 to 12`, and the value elements range from `-10000 to 10000`. The program displays the array before the sort, the relevant steps during the sort, the array after the sort, and the side-by-side comparison of the array before and after the sort.
